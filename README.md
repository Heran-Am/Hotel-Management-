# Hotel_Management
This is a simple project about Hotel management system with python using object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming concepts.

## General
The Hotel Management System offers a user-friendly interface for efficient hotel operations. Key features include:

- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive GUI for easy navigation and task execution.

- Efficient Data Management: Stores and manages guest information effectively.

- Functional Programming: Utilizes functional programming concepts for enhanced code readability.

- Data Storage Layer (DSL): Handles data storage and retrieval, ensuring reliability.

- Flexible and Extensible: Easily customizable to adapt to changing needs.

- Open-Source: Source code available for modification and distribution.

## Features

- Check-in: Add guests to the hotel database with their details.
- Check-out: Remove guests from the hotel database.
- List Guests: View a list of all guests currently staying at the hotel.
- Get Guest Info: Retrieve detailed information about a specific guest.
- Generate Receipt: Generate a receipt for a guest.


## 1. Git 
My experience on GitHub as a beginner has been enriching. Through exploration and experimentation, I've delved into the world of version control, discovering the power of collaborative development. With each commit, push, and pull request, I've gained invaluable insights and honed my skills. As I continue this journey, I look forward to further growth and contribution within the vibrant GitHub community.

 ## 3. DDD
In my project, I embraced Domain-Driven Design (DDD) because it emphasizes understanding the core domain, setting clear boundaries, and fostering collaboration through shared language.

To kicked off the project, I organized a brainstorming session [brainstorming session](DDD/brainstorming.png) where we outlined our goals and features collaboratively. Techniques like mind mapping helped us generate ideas and prioritize requirements, laying the groundwork for our development plan.

  Next, I dived deep into understanding key domain concepts, aiming for clarity and insight. This informed better decision-making as we moved forward.

With a solid grasp of domain ideas [DDD](DDD/domainideas.png), I focused on developing a 'ubiquitous language' [ubiquitous language](DDD/domainUbiquitious%20language.png) shared vocabulary for smooth communication and understanding among team members.

To visualize our project's structure, I created a context map [context map](DDD/content%20mapping.png), outlining key content and its relationships. This served as a visual roadmap for our development journey.

Finally, I distilled our core domain into a chart, providing a clear overview of its components and interactions. [Core domain](DDD/core%20domain.png)

## 5. Clean Code Development
Clean code Developement [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/Heran-Am/hotel_managment/blob/main/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.txt) is here and example from the code.

Comments/Doctstrings : Use Docstrings or comments to explain the function/methods.

Modularity: The code is structured into smaller components for improved [readability](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?metric=reliability_remediation_effort&id=Heran-Am_hotel_managment). Indentation, spacing, and line breaks are used effectively to enhance code quality. 

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Reusable functions, modules, or libraries can help prevent code [duplication](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?metric=Duplications&id=Heran-Am_hotel_managment). In sonarcloud metrics, we can see no duplication Duplicated Lines 




Functional Programming
The functional_programming.py file contains functions that demonstrate functional programming concepts such as filtering and mapping over guest data.

Data Storage Layer (DSL)
The Dsl.py file implements the Data Storage Layer, providing functions to handle hotel data storage and retrieval.
