## 1. Git 
My experience on GitHub as a beginner has been enriching. Through exploration and experimentation, I've delved into the world of version control, discovering the power of collaborative development. With each commit, push, and pull request, I've gained invaluable insights and honed my skills. As I continue this journey, I look forward to further growth and contribution within the vibrant GitHub community.

## 2. UML


 ## 3. DDD
In my project, I embraced Domain-Driven Design (DDD) because it emphasizes understanding the core domain, setting clear boundaries, and fostering collaboration through shared language.

To kicked off the project, I organized a brainstorming session [brainstorming session](DDD/brainstorming.png) where we outlined our goals and features collaboratively. Techniques like mind mapping helped us generate ideas and prioritize requirements, laying the groundwork for our development plan.

  Next, I dived deep into understanding key domain concepts, aiming for clarity and insight. This informed better decision-making as we moved forward.

With a solid grasp of domain ideas [DDD](DDD/domainideas.png), I focused on developing a 'ubiquitous language' [ubiquitous language](DDD/domainUbiquitious%20language.png) shared vocabulary for smooth communication and understanding among team members.

To visualize our project's structure, I created a context map [context map](DDD/content%20mapping.png), outlining key content and its relationships. This served as a visual roadmap for our development journey.

Finally, I distilled our core domain into a chart, providing a clear overview of its components and interactions. [Core domain](DDD/core%20domain.png)

## 5. Clean Code Development
Clean code Developement [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/Heran-Am/Hotel-Management-/blob/main/cheatsheet.txt) is here and example from the code.

Comments/Doctstrings : Use Docstrings or comments to explain the function/methods.

Modularity: The code is structured into smaller components for improved. Indentation, spacing, and line breaks are used effectively to enhance code quality. 

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Reusable functions, modules, or libraries can help prevent code [duplication](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=Heran-Am_Hotel-Management-&metric=duplicated_lines_density&view=list). In sonarcloud metrics, we can see no duplication Duplicated Lines.

Unittest: There is a also comprehensive unit test [Unittest](https://github.com/Heran-Am/Hotel-Management-/blob/main/test.py)

[Readability](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?metric=Reliability&id=Heran-Am_Hotel-Management-): Make the code easy to read and understand. Avoid long lines of code that require horizontal scrolling.

## 6. & 7. Build and CI/CD  Workflow

As points 6 and 7 seamlessly integrate into my development process. Leveraging GitHub Actions for build and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) has been a game-changer. Since my project is in Python, GitHub Actions felt like the natural choice. While other build management systems like Ant, Maven, and Gradle are more commonly associated with Java projects, I found GitHub Actions to be a perfect fit for Python.


[Test](https://github.com/Heran-Am/Hotel-Management-/blob/main/test.py): Unit tests and integration tests play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and reliability of our codebase. GitHub Actions empowers me to execute these tests seamlessly, catching bugs before they become problems. The CI/CD pipeline defined in a YAML-based configuration file within my GitHub repository keeps everything organized and efficient.

[Build](https://github.com/Heran-Am/Hotel-Management-/actions/runs/8711759514/job/23896578005): Our pipeline handles everything from compiling source code to bundling assets and generating artifacts for deployment. But it wasn't all smooth sailing â€“ during testing, I encountered some stubborn error messages that brought the pipeline to a halt. With persistence and determination, I tackled each issue head-on, refusing to give up until the tests passed. It was a journey of trial and error, but in the end, it was worth it.

GitHub Actions enables us to set up CI/CD pipelines directly within our GitHub repository, streamlining our development process and ensuring that our code is always in top shape.github/workflows directory of my GitHub repository..[ymlfile](https://github.com/Heran-Am/Hotel-Management-/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml)

## 8. Unitest
I have written two unitest 
1, test_import:

Purpose: This test ensures that the module getinfoui is imported successfully.
Assertion: It checks if the imported module getinfoui is not None.

And the Second unitest
2, test_hotel_management_class_exists:

Purpose: This test verifies if the HotelManagementApp class exists in the imported module.
Assertion: It checks if the getinfoui module has an attribute named 'HOTEL_MANAGEMENT', which should correspond to the HotelManagementApp class.

here is the [unitest](https://github.com/Heran-Am/Hotel-Management-/blob/main/test.py)


## 9. IDE

I've opted for Visual Studio as my IDE for this project for several reasons. It offers a rich set of features and tools essential for software development, such as code editing, debugging, testing, and version control integration. Visual Studio supports various programming languages, frameworks, and platforms, making it versatile and suitable for diverse projects.

Here are some of my favorite shortcuts in Visual Studio:

1.Ctrl + D: Duplicate line or selection.

2.Ctrl + /: Toggle line comment.

3.Ctrl + Shift + L: Select all occurrences of the current selection.

4.Ctrl + Shift + K: Delete line.

5.Ctrl + Shift + P: Open command palette. 

6.Ctrl + Shift + F: Search across files.

7.Ctrl + Shift + O: Go to symbol (methods, classes, etc.).

8.Ctrl + F5: Run without debugging.

9.Ctrl + F9: Toggle breakpoint.

10.Ctrl + Shift + V: Open Markdown preview.

These shortcuts help streamline my coding workflow and boost productivity in Visual Studio.


## 10. DSL (Data Storage and Loading)
The DSL.py module provides functionality for storing and loading data used in the hotel management application. It includes the following functions:

save_guest_data(guest_data):

Saves guest data to the "hotel.dat" file using pickle serialization.
Parameters: guest_data (list) - List of guest objects to be saved.
Exceptions: Handles FileNotFoundError if the "hotel.dat" file is not found.
load_guest_data():

Loads guest data from the "hotel.dat" file.
Returns: List of guest objects loaded from the file.
Exceptions: Handles FileNotFoundError if the "hotel.dat" file is not found.
save_receipt_data(receipt_data):

Saves receipt data to the "receipt.txt" file.
Parameters: receipt_data (list) - List of strings representing receipt lines.
Exceptions: Handles FileNotFoundError if the "receipt.txt" file is not found.
load_receipt_data():

Loads receipt data from the "receipt.txt" file.
Returns: List of strings representing receipt lines loaded from the file.
Exceptions: Handles FileNotFoundError if the "receipt.txt" file is not found.
These functions are essential for managing the persistence of guest and receipt data within the application.
